# React expensify app

To test or run the application, copy `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env.test` or `.env.development` and replace
the firebase credentials with your own.

After setting your credentials, run this commands in your command line:

- `npm install` or `yarn install`
- `npm start` or `yarn start`

For running the tests:

- `npm run test` or `yarn test`

Note: if you want to run the test, remember to create the `.env.test` with your firebase credentials,
otherwise it will crash.
